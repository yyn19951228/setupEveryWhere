# Tips for my usage for coc-nvim

## General
1. Make sure that vim version is following the requirements, for now, vim should >= 8.0
2. The `go to definition` is different from vanilla vim. So in the configuration file provided by coc-nvim, the go to definition points to <coc-definitions>, and will be called by using `gd` by default, and the `<C-]>` is the default settings using tags, which will be superseded by coc-nvim

## Python
1. As mentioned in the coc-python, should set "python.jediEnabled" to false to use Microsoft Python Language Server(MPLS)
2. For import the module in the Project/Dir, MPLS might have issues identify them, so we need 
    1. First identify the Project/Dir, checkout here https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-workspaceFolders
    or using `:CocList folders` to check, the default settings is to find .git 
    2. Creating a .env file under Project/Dir, and add the following directories like 
    PYTHONPATH="src/directory1:src/directory2" for
    project-root
    ├── .git
    ├── .env
    └── src
	├── directory1
	│   ├── file1.py (import file2)
	│   └── file2.py (import file1)
	└── directory2
	    ├── file1.py (import file2)
	    └── file2.py (import file1)
